**Summary**:

The model was build by using the following [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset). 
Logistic Regression, Decision Trees Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine, Multinomial Naive Byaes, KNearestNeighbor and Extra Trees Classifier was used to train the model. Support Vector Machine gave us the best model metrics, so I converted it into a pickel file and saved it.
